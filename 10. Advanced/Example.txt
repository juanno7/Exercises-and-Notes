Exercise: Create a simple console-based tic-tac-toe game where two players can take turns to make moves.
Walkthrough:

Create a new Java class file, e.g., TicTacToe.java.
Implement a 2D array to represent the game board.
Allow two players to take turns, entering their moves.
Check for a win condition or a draw after each move.
Display the game board and the result.
2. Logical Branching and Loops

Exercise: Implement a program that generates a random math quiz with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division questions. Allow the user to answer, and keep track of their score.
Walkthrough:

Create a new Java class file, e.g., MathQuiz.java.
Generate random math questions with different operators.
Prompt the user to answer the questions and validate their responses.
Keep track of the user's score and display it at the end.
3. Arrays and Command-Line Programs

Exercise: Write a program that simulates a basic inventory management system using arrays and files. Allow users to add, update, list, and remove products from the inventory. Save the inventory data to a file.
Walkthrough:

Create a new Java class file, e.g., InventoryManagement.java.
Use arrays to store product information (name, quantity, price).
Implement methods for adding, updating, listing, and removing products.
Read and write inventory data to a file (e.g., a text file) for persistence.
4. Introduction to Objects

Exercise: Model a library system with classes for books, patrons, and library records. Implement methods for borrowing and returning books, as well as tracking due dates.

Walkthrough:

Create Java class files for Book, Patron, and LibraryRecord.
Define attributes and methods for each class.
Implement book borrowing, returning, and due date tracking in the LibraryRecord class.
Create instances of books, patrons, and library records to simulate interactions in the library.
5. Lists, Stacks, Queues, and Maps

Exercise: Develop a Java program that simulates a basic task management system using ArrayList for tasks. Allow users to create tasks, set priorities, mark tasks as complete, and list tasks by priority.
Walkthrough:

Create a new Java class file, e.g., TaskManager.java.
Use an ArrayList to store task objects with attributes like name, description, and priority.
Implement methods for adding, updating, and listing tasks.
Allow users to mark tasks as complete and prioritize them.
6. Classes and Encapsulation

Exercise: Model an online shopping system with classes for products, customers, and orders. Implement methods for adding products to a cart, calculating order totals, and processing orders.
Walkthrough:

Create Java class files for Product, Customer, and Order.
Define attributes and methods for each class.
Implement cart management, order calculation, and order processing logic.
Simulate a customer's shopping experience by adding products to a cart and placing orders.
7. Inheritance and Polymorphism

Exercise: Extend the shape hierarchy example from earlier to include additional shapes like "Triangle" and "Square." Implement their area and perimeter calculation methods.
Walkthrough:

Create Java class files for Triangle and Square, extending the Shape hierarchy.
Provide implementations for area and perimeter calculations for these new shapes.
Use polymorphism to calculate areas and perimeters for various shapes in the main method.
8. Unit Testing and Exception Handling

Exercise: Enhance the calculator program from earlier to handle more complex expressions, including parentheses and operator precedence. Write comprehensive unit tests to verify its correctness.
Walkthrough:

Modify the Calculator class to handle complex expressions using appropriate data structures (e.g., stacks).
Implement parsing and evaluation logic for expressions with parentheses and operator precedence.
Write a suite of JUnit tests to cover various expression scenarios and verify the calculator's accuracy.
