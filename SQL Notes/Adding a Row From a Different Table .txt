country:

country_id	name
1		Canada
2		Mexico
3		Cuba
4		France
5		Spain
6		Italy
7		China

city:

city_id	country_id	name
1	6		Milan
2	6		Rome
3	7		Beijing
4	4		Nice
5	4		Paris
6	1		Toronto
7	5		Seville


These two tables both have primary keys, but the city table also has a foreign key called country_id that links to the country table. In SQL, that looks something like this:

ALTER TABLE city ADD FOREIGN KEY (country_id) REFERENCES country(country_id);
