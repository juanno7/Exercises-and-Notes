There are three types of SQL statements:

The Data Manipulation Language (DML) that allows a programmer to insert, update, and delete data from the tables and select that data back out again.

The Data Definition Language (DDL) that allows a programmer to create new tables and define the data types of the columns on tables.

The Data Control Language (DCL) that allows a programmer to specify new users of the database and which tables and actions they have access to.
