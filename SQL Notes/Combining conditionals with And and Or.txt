Combining conditionals with AND and OR

You can put conditionals together in a SELECT statement to get the rows you want.

For example, if you have a person table and want to get all the rows that represent children, you could write a statement like this:

-- Select all children from the database
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM person WHERE age < 18;
You can also combine these conditionals using the keywords AND and OR to make more complex statements:

-- Select all the first names of children with a last name of Smith from the database
SELECT first_name FROM person WHERE age < 18 AND last_name = 'Smith';
