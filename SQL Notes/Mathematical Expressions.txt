Mathematical expressions
You can perform mathematical operations in SQL statements. You can either perform operations between columns, or a column and a literal:

-- add 3 to everybody's age
SELECT age + 3 FROM person;

-- calculate sales tax
SELECT subtotal * 0.05 FROM sale;

-- calculate total employee compensation (salary + bonus)
SELECT salary + bonus FROM employee;
You can write these expressions in the SELECT clause of statements, as shown here. You can also write them in WHERE clauses, which you'll learn about in the next lesson.
