The IN conditional

The IN conditional works like multiple OR conditions for one column and multiple values. 
For example, if you wanted to get people named Mary, Ted, or Alex, you'd write a query like this:

-- Get all people with the first name of Mary, Ted, or Alex
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM person WHERE first_name IN ('Mary', 'Ted', 'Alex');

The BETWEEN conditional

The BETWEEN conditional is like using a greater than or equal (>=) and a less than or equal (<=) together. 
This query is equivalent to using WHERE age >= 18 AND age <= 34:

-- Get all people whose age is between 18 and 34 (inclusive)
SELECT first_name, last_name, age FROM person WHERE age BETWEEN 18 AND 34;

You can also use NOT in front of BETWEEN to get all rows that aren't in a range:

SELECT first_name, last_name, age FROM person WHERE age NOT BETWEEN 18 AND 34;
