Updating existing rows
Data is often changed in a system—for example, changing your user profile or updating a blog post—so having a way to update data is important. For instance, you can use an UPDATE statement to change the name of Honduras to its full, official name:

UPDATE country SET name = 'The Republic of Honduras'
WHERE code = 'HND';

You'll see the familiar WHERE clause here, which now selects which rows you want to update.

Warning: Use your WHERE clause on every UPDATE
If you forget the WHERE clause, the update happens on every row in the table, changing all of your data. To make sure that you update the correct rows, write a SELECT statement first:

SELECT * FROM country
WHERE code = 'HND';

Once you've verified that it brings back the rows you want, change it to an UPDATE statement.

Here's the structure of an UPDATE statement:

UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
