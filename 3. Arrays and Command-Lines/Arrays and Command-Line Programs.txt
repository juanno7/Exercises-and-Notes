Arrays and Command-Line Programs

Arrays are collections of elements of the same data type.

Arrays are zero-indexed, and you can access elements using their index.

Command-line programs accept user input from the command line.

Use args[] to access command-line arguments.

Example: Sum and average calculation using arrays.
Example (Arrays):

java
Copy code
int[] numbers = {5, 10, 15, 20, 25};
int sum = 0;

for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    sum += numbers[i];
}

double average = (double) sum / numbers.length;
System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
System.out.println("Average: " + average);
Example (Command-Line Program):

java
Copy code
public class CommandLineArgs {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        if (args.length > 0) {
            System.out.println("You provided " + args.length + " command-line arguments.");
            for (String arg : args) {
                System.out.println("Argument: " + arg);
            }
        } else {
            System.out.println("No command-line arguments provided.");
        }
    }
}
These examples illustrate the concepts in a practical context, making it easier to understand how they work in Java programming. Feel free to experiment with and modify these examples to deepen your understanding.
