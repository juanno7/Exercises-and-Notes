Exercise: Write a Java program to find the sum and average of elements in an array.
Walkthrough:

Create a new Java class file, e.g., ArraySumAndAverage.java.
Inside the class, declare an array of integers and initialize it with some values.
Use a for loop to iterate through the array and calculate the sum of all elements.
Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements.
Print both the sum and average to the console.
java
Copy code
public class ArraySumAndAverage {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {5, 10, 15, 20, 25};
        int sum = 0;

        for (int number : numbers) {
            sum += number;
        }

        double average = (double) sum / numbers.length;

        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
        System.out.println("Average: " + average);
    }
}
