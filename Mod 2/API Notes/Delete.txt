DELETE requests

DELETE requests usually only require the ID, like PUT requests, but they don't require any additional data. You also don't need to use the type parameter as you won't usually receive any data from a DELETE request:

RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();

restTemplate.delete(API_URL + "users/23");
