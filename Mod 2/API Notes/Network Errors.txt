Network errors
RestTemplate alerts an application of any errors by throwing Java exceptions rather than returning error or status codes. This means using try/catch blocks.

In the case of general network I/O, errors that prevent the request from reaching the server, like the server being offline, or prevent the response from coming back, like losing your connection, are reflected as a failure to access a resource.

RestTemplate throws a ResourceAccessException to alert the application that there was a network I/O problem:

try {
    restTemplate.put(API_URL + "users/remove/23");
}
catch (ResourceAccessException e) {
    System.out.println(e.getMessage());
}

Since the error is related to the network, the application usually can't resolve the issue unless the error is an invalid URL or a similar configuration issue. Frequently, the only course of action is to report the error and possibly allow the user to retry.
