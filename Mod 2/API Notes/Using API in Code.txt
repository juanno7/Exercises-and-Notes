RestTemplate serves as the client within the Spring framework. It facilitates the execution of HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Here RestTemplate calls on its getForEntity() method to make a basic HTTP GET request to the ExchangeRate-API:

RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate(); // Create a new client

ResponseEntity response = restTemplate.getForEntity(
                "https://api.exchangerate-api.com/v4/latest/USD",
                String.class); // Make GET request using client

System.out.println(response.getBody()); // Your return data returned from .getBody()

Note: What does response.getBody() return?

response.getBody() returns a string representation of the JSON, just like if you saw the API response in your browser. In the next section, you'll see how RestTemplate can automatically convert the response data into a Java object.
