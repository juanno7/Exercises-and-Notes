Actions on resources
The HTTP method defines the action on a resource. You've already seen GET and POST, while you may not have seen PUT and DELETE until now. These four methods are commonly used for "CRUD" operations on your resources.

CRUD
CRUD is an acronym that stands for Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete. These are the four basic operations that you can perform on data:

To Create a new resource, you POST data to the URL for that resource.
To Retrieve resources, you GET from the URL for that resource. You can set this up to send search parameters to specify which todos you want, like GET /todos/search?task=hotels or GET /todos/search?dueAfter=2023-10-15.
To Retrieve a specific resource, you GET from a resource URL with an ID.
To Update a resource, you PUT data to a resource URL with an ID.
To Delete a resource, you DELETE a resource URL with an ID.
The following table shows you how these CRUD operations apply to the /todos example:

Operation	HTTP Method	URL					Use


Create		POST		/todos				Create a new todo using data passed in the request

Retrieve	GET		/todos				Retrieve all todos

Retrieve	GET		/todos/search?task=hotels	Retrieve all todos that match the search

Retrieve	GET		/todos/5			Retrieve the todo with an ID of 5

Update		PUT		/todos/5			Update an existing todo with an ID of 5 using data passed in the request

Delete		DELETE		/todos/5			Delete the todo with an ID of 5
