HTTP status codes
APIs return HTTP status codes, and these status codes inform frontend applications if any errors occurred or if everything worked successfully. Here are some common codes returned:

Code	Description	Use

200	OK		Everything worked as expectedâ€”data returned in the response body. Common response to GET requests and to PUT requests when response 			includes data.
201	Created		The request created a new resource on the server. Common response to POST requests.

204	No Content	Everything worked but there is no data returned. Common response to DELETE requests and to PUT requests when response doesn't 				include data.
304	Not Modified	The data hasn't changed since it was last retrieved. Used to respond to GET requests so data doesn't have to be re-downloaded if it 			hasn't changed.
400	Bad Request	The request from the frontend had errors. Check the data passed back to see more specifics about the error. Often a data validation 			problem.
401	Unauthorized	The user isn't allowed to perform this action either because they aren't logged in or because their login information is wrong.

403	Forbidden	The logged in user isn't allowed to perform this action because they don't have permission.

404	Not Found	The given URL doesn't point to a valid resource.

405	Method Not Allowed	The HTTP method used isn't valid for this URL. This could be because the server doesn't allow creating, updating or deleting 				the resource.
500	Internal Server Error	The API itself has a problem and can't fulfill the request at this time. This could be due to a code issue or because 					services the API relies on, like databases or application servers, are down.
