Request path
What about a scenario where you want to find a specific todo by its ID? You could use a query string parameter for that—like /todos?id=2—but a popular REST convention is to use the ID as a part of the request path:

# request path variable example
http://localhost:8080/todos/2
That request says, "Get the todo where its ID is 2."

This is the handler method called for that request. Notice the @PathVariable annotation in the parameter list:

@RequestMapping(path = "/todos/{id}", method = RequestMethod.GET)
public Todo get(@PathVariable int id) {
    return todoDao.getTodoById(id);
}

Model binding goes through the following steps after the routing system selects the handler method:

Finds a parameter of get() with the @PathVariable annotation, an int named id.
Looks at the path of the HTTP request and finds "2" in the position labeled {id} in the @RequestMapping annotation.
Converts the string "2" into the int value 2 and assigns it to the argument id.
