SELECT statements
To begin, you'll learn how to select data from a database. This is one of the main types of statements you'll use when developing a typical business application.

For these examples, assume that you have a database table that looks like this:

Sample table


code	name	                 continent	   region
CYM	Cayman Islands	        North America	  Caribbean
CHL	Chile	                South America	  South America
COK	Cook Islands	        Oceania	          Polynesia
CRI	Costa Rica	        North America	  Central America
DJI	Djibouti	        Africa	Eastern   Africa
DMA	Dominica	        North America	  Caribbean
DOM	Dominican Republic	North America	  Caribbean
ECU	Ecuador	South America	South America



In this database, the table would have a name. Here, it's called the country table. If you want to get the names of all the countries in the country table, you'd run the following statement:

SELECT name FROM country;
Result:

name
Cayman Islands
Chile
Cook Islands
Costa Rica
Djibouti
Dominica
Dominican Republic
Ecuador
...

This is a SELECT statement. All SELECT statements start with the keyword SELECT followed by the name of the column from which you want to retrieve data. After that's the FROM keyword, which specifies the table from which you want to retrieve the data. The database returns the value in the name column of every row in the country table.

You can select more than one column from the table by separating each column name with a comma, as the following shows:

SELECT name, continent FROM country;
Result:

name	continent
Cayman Islands	North America
Chile	South America
Cook Islands	Oceania
Costa Rica	North America
Djibouti	Africa
Dominica	North America
Dominican Republic	North America
Ecuador	South America
...	...

There is also a shortcut for selecting all the columns of a table. That shortcut is to use the * symbol, which means all:

SELECT * FROM country;
Result:

code	name	                 continent	   region
CYM	Cayman Islands	        North America	  Caribbean
CHL	Chile	                South America	  South America
COK	Cook Islands	        Oceania	          Polynesia
CRI	Costa Rica	        North America	  Central America
DJI	Djibouti	        Africa	Eastern   Africa
DMA	Dominica	        North America	  Caribbean
DOM	Dominican Republic	North America	  Caribbean
ECU	Ecuador	South America	South America
