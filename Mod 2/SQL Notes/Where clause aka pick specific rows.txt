There are times when you don't want to select all the rows stored in a table. If you want to pick and choose which rows to pull back from the database, you need to use a WHERE clause:

SELECT * FROM country WHERE continent = 'North America';
Result:

code	name	                continent	   region

CYM	Cayman Islands	        North America	   Caribbean
CRI	Costa Rica	        North America	   Central America
DMA	Dominica	        North America	   Caribbean
DOM	Dominican Republic	North America	   Caribbean
...	...	...	...

In defining a WHERE clause, you only extract the rows you want from the database. In this example, the database pulls rows where the data in continent is equal to 'North America.'

Note: Equality in SQL
In Java, you use double equals to see if two things are equal. In SQL, you use one equal.
