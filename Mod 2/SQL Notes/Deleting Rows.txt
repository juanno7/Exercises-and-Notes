Deleting rows
Sometimes you want to delete data from the database and remove it completely. You can do this with a DELETE statement:

DELETE FROM country
WHERE code = 'HND';

This deletes any row from the database that matches the WHERE clause.

Danger: 

Be sure of what you're deleting
As stated with UPDATE statements, if you leave off the WHERE clause on a DELETE statement, all the rows in the table get deleted. There is no undo in SQL, at least not yet, so once they're gone, they're gone.

It's better to write a SELECT statement first, make sure those are the rows you want to delete, and then change it to a DELETE statement afterwards.


This is the standard format of a DELETE statement:

DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

Note:
 
In most real world applications, you don't delete often
In most real applications, you don't delete a lot of data. Data is valuable and keeping data that you don't need anymore can have its advantages. If a customer calls and says that they accidentally deleted something they didn't mean to, you'll be glad you kept it in the database.

So how are deletes handled then? Usually, you have a boolean column like enabled or deleted, or a date column like deleted_date, and set that when you want something "deleted." Then all of your SELECT statements can look for that when pulling data from the database.

You can retrieve all users accounts from a database that haven't been deleted like this:

SELECT * FROM user_account
WHERE deleted_date IS NULL;
