Instead of manually counting the rows, you can tell the database to count the rows like this:

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM child;
Result:

count
4
Using these functions, you can collapse your data down into pieces of information. COUNT(*) tells you how many rows are returned from the statement.

You can use WHERE clauses to filter the data down too. If you run the following statement:

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM child WHERE last_name = 'Smith';
It gives you this result:

count
2
So, COUNT(*) counts the number of rows.

There are some other aggregate functions, too.

AVG(column) returns the average value in a certain column:

SELECT AVG(age) FROM child;
avg
9.5
SUM(column) adds up all the value from a certain column:

SELECT SUM(age) FROM child;
sum
38
MIN(column) gives you the smallest value in that column:

SELECT MIN(age) FROM child;
min
8
MAX(column) gives you the largest value in that column:

SELECT MAX(age) FROM child;
max
11
