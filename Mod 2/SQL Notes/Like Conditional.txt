The LIKE conditional

LIKE is a special conditional that only works with character data. It allows for "wildcard" searches. Look at the following SQL statement:

-- Get all last names that end in son

SELECT last_name FROM person WHERE last_name LIKE '%son';
This statement returns all rows where the last_name ends in son. The % is called a wildcard. It matches anything, so the preceding statement returns names like Erickson, Benson, and Danielson, but it won't return sonny or Wilsonn. The string must end in son because the % is at the beginning.

If you want to only get rows where the last_name begins with Ba, write the following:

-- Get all last names that begin with Ba

SELECT last_name FROM person WHERE last_name LIKE 'Ba%';
If you want to only get rows where the last_name has the string ski anywhere in it, including having the string start with or end with ski, write the following:

-- Get all last names that contain ski anywhere

SELECT last_name FROM person WHERE last_name LIKE '%ski%';
