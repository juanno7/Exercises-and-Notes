The IS NULL and IS NOT NULL conditionals
You can use IS NULL and IS NOT NULL to retrieve rows where a value is or isn't null:

-- Get all people who don't have a favorite color
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM person WHERE favorite_color IS NULL;

-- Get all people who DO have a favorite color
SELECT first_name, last_name, color FROM person WHERE favorite_color IS NOT NULL;
